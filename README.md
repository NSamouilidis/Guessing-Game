#Guessing Game

#Welcome

#Have a nice (Guessing) game.

A simple and fun console-based Java game where the computer randomly selects a number
and the player tries to guess it. After each guess, the program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. 
The game continues until the player correctly guesses the number.
